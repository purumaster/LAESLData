# LAESLData
My project plan.
  I am working on English Second Language. There are many people from other countries in our school. Some of them are graduated from High school, but some of them are not. I would like to research about our students.
  
  1. How many countires and Languages are represented in our school.
  2. Gender and ages.
  3. How many students are graduated from High schgool in their countries.
  4. How many students are interested in GED.
